# SDLC_Models
## Waterfall SDLC Model
This SDLC model includes gradual execution of every stage completely

*PROS*

* Simple to use and understand
* Easy to classify and prioritize tasks
* Perfect for the small or mid-sized projects where requirements are clear and not equivocal

*CONS*
* Not the best choice for complex and object-oriented projects
* High risks and uncertainty

## Agile SDLC Model
In the agile methodology after every development iteration, the customer is able to see the result and understand if he is satisfied with it or he is not

*PROS*

* Fast release of the first product version
* Risks are minimized thanks to the flexible change process

*CONS*

* Difficulties with measuring the final cost because of permanent changes

**Unlike the Waterfall model, it requires only initial planning to start the project**

## Iterative SDLC Model
The Iterative SDLC model does not need the full list of requirements before the project starts. The development process may start with the requirements to the functional part, which can be expanded later.The process is repetitive, allowing to make new versions of the product for every cycle

*PROS*

* Problems and risks defined within one iteration can be prevented in the next sprints
* Flexibility and readiness to the changes in the requirements
* It is easier to control the risks as high-risk tasks are completed first

*CONS*

* Iterative model requires more resources than the waterfall model
* The process is difficult to manage

**Applied to the large-scale projects** **The main task is predefined, but the details may advance with the time**
