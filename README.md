# SDLC_Models
## Waterfall SDLC Model
This SDLC model includes gradual execution of every stage completely

*PROS*

* Simple to use and understand
* Easy to classify and prioritize tasks
* Perfect for the small or mid-sized projects where requirements are clear and not equivocal

*CONS*
* Not the best choice for complex and object-oriented projects
* High risks and uncertainty

## Agile SDLC Model**
In the agile methodology after every development iteration, the customer is able to see the result and understand if he is satisfied with it or he is not

*PROS*

* Fast release of the first product version
* Risks are minimized thanks to the flexible change process

*CONS*

* Difficulties with measuring the final cost because of permanent changes

**Unlike the Waterfall model, it requires only initial planning to start the project**
